/*
useParams is a hook provided by react-router-dom 
that allows you to access URL parameters in functional components. 
URL parameters are dynamic segments in the URL path 
that are denoted by a colon followed by a parameter name.

---
So, if the URL for this component is 
/users/123, id will be '123', 
and the component will render "User ID: 123".
